# The Greenhouse Effect: Earth's Natural Climate System

## How It Works

The greenhouse effect is like Earth's natural blanket system:

1. **Solar Energy In**: The Sun sends energy to Earth as visible light
2. **Surface Absorption**: Earth's surface absorbs this energy and warms up
3. **Heat Radiation**: The warm surface radiates energy back as infrared heat
4. **Atmospheric Interaction**: Greenhouse gases absorb some of this heat
5. **Re-radiation**: The atmosphere radiates heat both up to space and back down to Earth

## Key Greenhouse Gases

| Gas | Source | Contribution |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) | Fossil fuels, deforestation | ~76% |
| Methane (CH₄) | Agriculture, landfills | ~16% |
| Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) | Fertilizers, fossil fuels | ~6% |
| Fluorinated gases | Industrial processes | ~2% |

## The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

Human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations:
- Pre-industrial CO₂: ~280 ppm
- Current CO₂: ~420 ppm
- This enhancement intensifies the natural greenhouse effect

## Scientific Evidence

- Temperature records from weather stations
- Ice core data showing atmospheric composition
- Satellite measurements of energy balance
- Ocean temperature and chemistry changes
